         <p>  n the end of august 2013 something wonderful happened to me.
            I got a scholarship to study in china there i met alot of forigner people from all over the word, 
            I lived four years and half. <br>
         </p>
            <p>
            it was an Amazing experience. I could finally experience English with them in natural conversation,in the purpose to exchange,
            There was no choice. In the beginning I was so ashamed of my English, it was horrible,
            then i developped methode of reapeting phrases and stracut that my english speaker friends used,and listen to them alot
            words get into my mind naturaly just after few month of listening more than <br>
        </p>
           <p>
            One day,my friend introduce me to one kindergarten director to give some english lessons, at the beginig i was nervos but then i started to love kids and developped and a method to study and teach at the same time,
            kids learn their mother language by listening and visualizing i find out that songs and flashcards could help better than old method  to memorize and improve and to speak with confidente,communicate start with your ears and eyes,
            and slowly I started getting more and more confident.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            to day teaching kids is my hobby and speking english make me feel happy.
            join me together we play we forget book and we grow up in natural way.
